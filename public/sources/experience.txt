As dawn breaks in rural Sri Lanka, toddy tappers climb trees with rope loops and clay pots, moving from trunk to trunk with practiced ease. This centuries-old practice is more than a way to gather a drink — it is a livelihood, a rhythm of village mornings, and a tradition carried forward by skilled hands.
In Udawalawe, our Toddy Experience invites you into this heritage. Local hosts demonstrate the process of tapping the flower of the coconut or palmyrah tree, collecting sap that begins to ferment naturally within hours. You’ll learn how rope loops, clay pots, and deft movements keep the tradition alive, and how the craft supports communities with knowledge passed down over generations.
Guests are welcome to try simple elements under guidance — holding the clay pot, watching the sap drip, or observing the delicate cut made in the flower stalk.

In Udawalawe, our Pottery Experience invites you to step into this heritage, guided by those who keep the craft alive.

Traditional Fishing – Udawalawe
Subtitle: Nets, Nature & Nourishment
Snippet Intro
Join local fishermen on the waters of Udawalawe and learn time-honored fishing techniques. End the day with your own fresh catch, prepared village-style to share and enjoy.
 
Narrative
Fishing has always been more than a livelihood in Sri Lanka — it is a rhythm of life tied to water, patience, and community. In Udawalawe, our Traditional Fishing Experience lets you step into this heritage alongside local fishermen who know these waters best.
Your journey begins with guidance from a naturalist or staff member, who introduces the lake and its importance to village life. Out on the water, you sit in a small boat as the nets are cast, the morning light catching ripples on the surface. The fishermen share techniques passed down through generations, showing how timing, skill, and respect for the lake work together to bring in a catch.
As the boat glides, you’ll see birdlife along the shores and hear stories of how fishing sustains families in both food and tradition. For those who prefer to stay on land, the experience can also be arranged at an alternate location paired with a scenic bike ride instead of the boat.
When the nets are drawn in, the reward comes ashore: your freshly caught fish, prepared over a wood fire with village flavors. What began as a quiet morning on the water ends as a shared meal — simple, nourishing, and deeply tied to the place.
Every cast, every story, every bite carries authentic roots and living stories, connecting you to the spirit of Udawalawe’s waters and its people.
